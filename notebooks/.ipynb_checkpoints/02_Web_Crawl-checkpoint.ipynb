      "Our ecosystem is already over-burdened in certain respects, particularly with regard to biodiversity and the nitrate input into our soil. The expanses the agricultural industry uses for cultivation make it one of the contributors to these problems. It is also responsible for generating almost a quarter of greenhouse gas emissions and accounts for nearly 70 percent of water consumption. As a leading agricultural company, we are conscious of these issues and consider it our responsibility to develop far-reaching solutions. We see this as our duty and aim to include the entire value-added chain in the process.\n",
      "We have therefore set ourselves the following ecological targets for the period 2020 to 2030:\n",
      "\n",
      "The company shall become carbon-neutral.To accomplish this, Bayer will implement energy efficiency measures, switch to 100 percent electricity from renewable energies and offset the remaining emissions through biodiversity-enhancing carbon capture.In addition, the company will encourage its suppliers and the entire value-added chain even more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n",
      "A 30 percent reduction of field greenhouse gas footprint (per kilogram of yield) of the most emitting cropping systems in regions Bayer operates.This includes Bayer helping farmers to use climate-friendly methods, such as reducing plowing, which can release CO2 sequestered in the soil.\n",
      "A 30-percent reduction of the environmental impact of crop protection everywhere we operate.We aim to achieve this by developing new technologies that enable farmers to scale down crop protection product volumes and enable more precise application.\n",
      "\n",
      "Above and beyond that, Bayer will engage in further climate-related and environmental efforts – such as supporting projects to preserve (rain) forests and using more environmentally friendly packaging materials throughout the Group.\n",
